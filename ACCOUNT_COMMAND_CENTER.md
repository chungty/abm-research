# Account Command Center Design

## Vision: Intelligence-Driven Sales Execution

The Account Command Center transforms traditional ABM research from data collection into **actionable sales intelligence**. Instead of presenting raw research data, it synthesizes contextual insights into ready-to-execute sales strategies.

## Core Principle: Research → Intelligence → Action

**Traditional ABM Tools**: "Here's what we found about Genesis Cloud"
**Account Command Center**: "Here's exactly what to do next with Genesis Cloud"

## Account Intelligence Briefing Format

### 🎯 Opportunity Brief (30-Second Strategic Context)
```
Genesis Cloud is expanding 10x GPU capacity for Q1 2025 following CoreWeave's
$7.5B funding pressure. VP Ops Jennifer Martinez posted about power density
challenges 3 days ago. NVIDIA partnership creates warm intro path.
WINDOW: Next 14 days during infrastructure planning phase.

PRIMARY ANGLE: Predictive power monitoring prevents costly downtime during
rapid expansion. Reference CoreWeave case study (22% power optimization).
```

### ⚡ Priority Action Queue
Each contact receives:
- **Strategic Context**: Why this contact matters right now
- **Conversation Assets**: Pre-written LinkedIn messages and emails
- **Timing Strategy**: Optimal outreach windows based on triggers
- **Partnership Angles**: Warm introduction pathways
- **Competitive Positioning**: Key differentiators and conversation angles

### Example: Jennifer Martinez (VP Operations)
```
🔥 PRIORITY 1: Jennifer Martinez - VP Operations (Score: 94)

FOLLOW-UP: If no response in 3 days, warm intro via NVIDIA contact
```
