# Future ABM Enhancements

## Value-Add Content Tracking (High Priority)

**Current Problem:** When we offer white papers/frameworks, we drive them to our website which creates friction and limited tracking.

**Better Approach:**
- Send the white paper/framework directly (PDF attachment or link)
- Password-protect the content
- Track when they access/use it without requiring website visits
- Know engagement level without creating barriers

**Implementation Ideas:**
- PDF with password → track password usage
- Unique access links → track document opens/time spent
- Interactive content → track which sections they engage with
- Follow-up triggered by actual usage, not just download

**Why This Matters:** We earn their attention by providing immediate value, then we know who's actually engaging vs. just being polite.

## Salesperson Workflow Focus

**Dashboard should optimize for:**
- Understanding different contacts quickly
- What appeals to each contact type (CEOs vs. Directors vs. VPs)
- Ready-to-use outreach information
- Account enrichment workflow
- Pipeline management for ABM approach

## LinkedIn Integration Enhancements

**Current State:** Simulated LinkedIn research
**Future State:**
- Real LinkedIn profile scraping (within ToS)
- Recent post analysis for timing
- Network connection mapping
- Content engagement tracking
